## How to make a private GitHub Repository on the Challenge Organisation

This guide assumes that you've been invited to the GitHub Organisation for the Challenge Week and that you've accepted this invite. If you're unsure about this, please contact the Organisers in the Discord Server.

**Step 1:** Go to the following link: https://github.com/compsoc-oe-week

**Step 2:** Make a repository. You can do this by clicking the green 'New' button next to the repository search.

**Step 3:** Name your repository. This should be in the format '[track1/track2]_[teamName]'. For example, a team titled "Apples" on track 1 would name their repository 'track1_apples'.

**Step 4:** Under configuration, **MAKE SURE** that the repository visibility is **SET TO PRIVATE**.

**Step 5:** Once done, you're free to configure your repository in other ways. The  key requirements are that the repo is private and follows the naming convention. Click 'Create repository'

**Step 6:** To add your team members, click on 'Manage access'. Then click 'Add people' and select the GitHub usernames of your teammates. **Do not add anyone outside of your team to your private repository!**
